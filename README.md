The contents of this repository are the result of a task during the Bachelor's Degree, where we had to modify a base AI model to obtain the best results 
possible in the Kaggle competition of the same name (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahwagih/retina-blood-vessel).

The initial model was provided, and all modifications were individual, meaning that we had a base model and we always modified that. Only in the Best Model found in the
Results folder did we use many different modifications at the same time, so as to find if it really was the best model overall. 

The code in this repository is not all my creation, it is shared between two former colleagues of mine, and it has been modified by code revisioning tools to properly work,
as the aim is not to learn the code by heart but rather study its effects on the task at hand.
